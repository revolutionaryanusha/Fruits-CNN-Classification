# Fruits-CNN-Classification
"Fruit-CNN-Classification" repo trains a custom CNN model on the "fruits-360-original-size" dataset. Images are transformed, model has convolutional, max pooling, and linear layers. Accuracy is evaluated on test set. Modified model with additional layers is compared in terms of accuracy and parameter count.
